# Loan Approval Prediction 📊  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant details. The model is trained on historical loan data using **Machine Learning** techniques.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Applicant Information** (Gender, Marital Status, Education, Income, etc.)  
- **Loan Details** (Loan Amount, Loan Term, Credit History, etc.)  
- **Approval Status** (Approved/Rejected)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🎯 Model & Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical data  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns & correlations  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting the best features  
4. **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees  
5. **Evaluation:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score  

## 📈 Results  
- Accuracy achieved: **[86%]**
