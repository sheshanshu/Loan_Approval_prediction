# Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview
The **Loan Approval Prediction** project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on various applicant details. The objective is to assist financial institutions in making data-driven decisions while minimizing risk.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand patterns and correlations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Optimize input variables for better model performance.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Train and test different machine learning models.
- **Prediction & Insights:** Provide an accurate model for loan approval.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of information about loan applicants, including:
- **Applicant Income**
- **Coapplicant Income**
- **Loan Amount & Term**
- **Credit History**
- **Property Area**
- **Employment & Education Details**
- **Loan Approval Status (Target Variable)**

## Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Encoding categorical variables
- Standardizing numerical features

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of loan statuses
- Income and loan amount relationships
- Impact of credit history on approvals

### 3. Model Training & Evaluation
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **XGBoost**
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

### 4. Model Performance Comparison
- Selecting the best model based on accuracy and other metrics
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimization

## Key Findings
- Applicants with a **credit history** have a significantly higher chance of loan approval.
- **Self-employed applicants** tend to have a lower approval rate.
- Higher **applicant income and lower loan amounts** increase approval chances.
- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** models performed best.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Data analysis & machine learning
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Code execution & visualization
- **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn, XGBoost:** Model training & evaluation
